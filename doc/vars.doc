Variables
===

Rules:

    1. Within 1 goal, no vars should duplicate.

    2. A variable that was encountered in a preceding goal must only be a part of prefix.

    3. Some target variables may be prefix-only (bound-only). For example, if some
    arguments are specified directly instead of coming from the database (e.g. a date, a
    number, a specific string).

    4. In prefixes, all variables should form a descendant chain:

        YES:        NO:
        ------      ------
        mes <-      mes <-
            me          me
            es          es
            st          mt
            mt          st
